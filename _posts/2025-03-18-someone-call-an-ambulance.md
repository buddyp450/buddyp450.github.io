## Someone Call an Ambulance!

### The Bystander Effect

So, picture this: You’re deep in the trenches of your current ticket, mid-flow, writing some (probably) questionable code, when suddenly—**ping!**—a message drops in the team channel.

> “Hey everyone, production is down.”

That’s it. No **@** mentions. No context. Just chaos in a single sentence.

At this point, you’ve got two choices:
* Ignore it because, hey, there’s like 20 other people in this channel, and surely someone else will handle it. 
* Have an anxiety attack because… **_what if nobody does?_** What if you’re the only one who cares? What if management is secretly watching to see who steps up?

And suddenly, congratulations—you’ve just abandoned whatever you were working on to figure out if this is even _your_ problem to solve.

### The victim (a.k.a. customer 🙃)

There’s a lot of history behind this, but the short version is that people are less likely to take action when a responsibility is spread across a group. It’s called the bystander effect, and it’s why you can scream **“SOMEONE CALL AN AMBULANCE”** in a crowd and end up with a bunch of confused people waiting for _someone else_ to make the call.

And it’s exactly what happens when broad, responsibility-free messages get blasted into work channels.

### How This Messes With Your Brain (And Your Team)
First, there’s the performance anxiety spiral. If you struggle with imposter syndrome or just want to be seen as a high-performer, you’re gonna feel the need to jump in and look useful, even when you don’t have the full picture. You’ll drop your current work, spend 10 minutes reading through the company's issue management system, another 10 trying to piece together what’s actually happening, and then realize that…

_Someone else already handled it._

But now you’ve completely lost the flow of what you were _actually_ working on, and your brain is cooked. Nice.

And worst of all? Over time, it leads to team burnout and apathy. If messages like this keep happening, people start disengaging. Everyone gets tired of playing psychic detective and just stops responding. Eventually, the only people who react are the ones too anxious not to—usually the same few people, until they burn out, too.

### How To Make This Less Awful

This isn’t to say that you should never send a broad team message. Sometimes, it’s necessary! But if you don’t want to trigger the bystander effect and a chain reaction of wasted productivity, here’s how to do it better:

#### @ Someone Specific 
If you even vaguely have an idea of who needs to handle it, tag them directly. It stops the “someone else will handle it” effect in its tracks and at least starts on the track to the right responsible person(s).

#### Give Context. 

Instead of “Production is down,” try “Looks like our API is failing. @DevOps, can you check?” Now we know who should handle it and what’s wrong.

#### Encourage a Culture of Clear Ownership. 

If your team constantly deals with these vague, responsibility-free messages, it might be time to have a chat about clearer communication and ownership. Make it normal to call out who should handle what.

#### And If You’re The One Who Feels Obligated to Jump In? 

Take a breath. Ask yourself, “Is this actually my job to fix?” If not, let someone else take the lead. You don’t have to be the workplace hero every time.

### Final Thoughts (Or, Let’s Not Do This Again)

If you’ve ever dropped what you were doing to play corporate first responder because you felt like you had to, I see you. If you’ve ever sent a vague, panic-inducing message and wondered why no one responded, now you know.

Communication in dev teams is tricky, but if we can break the cycle of chaos, we might actually get some real work done. And hey—maybe next time, the ambulance will actually get called.
